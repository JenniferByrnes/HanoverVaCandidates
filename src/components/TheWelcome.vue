    <template #heading>Rob Wittman</template>

    Rob Wittman first ran for Congress in 2007, promising to be a champion of term limits - to serve at most 2 full terms.  16 years later, here we are - he's running for his 9th term.
<br/><br/>
    This <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2020/12/14/editorial-us-rep-rob-wittman-disappoints-by-backing-lawsuit-that-sought-to-overturn-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia Pilot article</a> is about his support for the January 6 traitors, whom he supported with his vote. 
    <br/><br/>

    He was named July 2023 <a href="https://www.cagw.org/porker-of-the-month/citizens-against-government-waste-names-rep-rob-wittman-july-2023-porker-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Porker of the Month</a> by Citizens Against Government Waste for his support of wastful unwanted (even by the Air Force!) spending on an unnecessary alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).
    <br/><br/>
    <a href="https://friendsofkeithbraxton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keith Braxton</a> is
a better choice.

    <template #heading>Buddy Fowler</template>

    Here are a set of issues that are a great reason not to support him:  He's against us having a clean environment, against equality for women, and pro unfettered gun access.  If you must, you can read more on
    <a href="https://www.buddyfowler.com/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his own webpage</a>  Yuck!.
    <br/><br/>
    Additionally, he doesn't actually live in the district that he wishes to "represent", unless you believe that he actually lives in a guest house on his legislative aide's property.

    Who is she?  No public events, no meet and greets and a no-show to the NAACP candidate forum.

    Rumored to be running solely to appoint her best friend to the school board.  Neither of them have kids in our public schools.

    <template #heading>Yael Levin</template>

    Registered claiming to be a 20 Hanover county resident though she moved here from Henrico 1.5 years ago.  Former(?) executive of No Left Turn.  Rumored to have moved here in order to run for Supervisor to appoint the school board member.

    Her major issue is harming trans people.  She has spent several speaking opportunities at school board meetings spewing untruths about trans surgery and trans kids.

    Believes that teachers can't afford housing in Hanover county because they foolishly buy expensive cars and can't handle their money.  Would solve the problem of run-down properties owned by the elderly by having the county purchase their homes (allowing the person to remain), wait for them to die, and then flip the home.
